                <p>
                    We&apos;re not expecting any of our guests to buy us any gifts. We&apos;ve been together 
                    for 13 years now and living in sin for 9 of those so we&apos;ve decided not to make a gift list. 
                    For us the most important thing is that you're going to share the day and celebrate with us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We&apos;ve booked a short trip to Paris / Disneyland for the Monday after the wedding and we&apos;re 
                    planning a longer honeymoon next year, possibly a trip travelling around America. <b>If</b> any of 
                    our guests really want to get us a gift, any donations to the honeymoon fund would be very gratefully received. 
                    <b>If</b> you want to do this and prefer not to use cash, you can use the following link and it will go into my
