                    We&apos;re not expecting any of our guests to buy us any gifts. We&apos;ve been together 
                    for 13 years now and living together for 9 of those so we won&apos;t be making a gift list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We&apos;ve booked a short trip to Paris / Disneyland for the Monday after the wedding and we&apos;re 
                    planning a longer honeymoon next year, hopefully a trip travelling around America. <b>If</b> any of 
                    our guests really want to get us something, any donations to the honeymoon fund would be gratefully received.

                    I&apos;ve opened a Monzo account to make it easier, so if you'd prefer not to use cash, you can make a
