# wedding-web
A simple website to display information about the wedding and link to the RSVP

#Why?
I am genuinely building this site for my wedding! We want to use this site to give our guests more information than we can fit 
on the invites and we're also doing our RSVP's online so this site will help point people to the right place. I don't tend to do 
so much front end coding these days so I'm also using it as an opportunity to get some practice with front end technologies and 
also Github!
