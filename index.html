            Who could have known when we met all those years ago at University that 13 years later, we&#039;d be getting married!
        </p>
        <p>
            We survived copious amounts of alcohol, exams, first jobs, crap jobs, long distances (mostly), moving across the country, 
            becoming mothers to a slightly derranged scruffy dog and buying our first house. On top of all of that, Sarah even managed 
            to convert Katy to a fully-fledged, literally card carrying, Eurovision fan. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We really hope you can join us to celebrate all of that and more!

            This site should hopefully be your go-to place for any information about our big day. You can 
            find information about things like the venue, the day and the local accommodation and we&#039;ll keep updating with 
            any more useful information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly though, this site will help you RSVP which we hope you&#039;ll do for us <b>really soon</b>.
