                    We really want to get the most of the venue so as part of the RSVP, we will ask you if there is anyone else you 
                    know who is attending who you would be willing to share a room with. This is because the rooms sleep 3 - 4 people 
                    so we just want to make the most of being able to have our friends and family with us all weekend. We know not all 
                    of our friends and family know eachother so don't worry if there's nobody you feel comfortable sharing with, 
                    we just need to know to help us arrange the rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you would like a room at Caer Llan, we will ask for you to send us the balance for your accommodation before 
                    the start of November. We'll contact you with payment details closer to the time. 
                </p>
