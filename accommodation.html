            There are a limited number of rooms available at Caer Llan. They all sleep 3 - 4 people so 
            we will ask you when you RSVP if you want one of these rooms and if you are willing to share 
            <b>with someone else you know</b>. 
            This allows us to get the most out of the venue on the day.
        </p>

            A room at Caer Llan costs <b>Â£150 per person</b> for the weekend. You can arrive from 6pm Friday and stay until 
            12pm Sunday. This price includes food on Friday night, breakfast on Saturday and Sunday morning, plus all the 
            tea and coffee you can drink.

            If you do request a room at Caer Llan, we'll let you know very soon if you are able to have one. We will then ask you 
            to transfer the money to us for the room to secure it for you. If you stay at Caer Llan, you cannot bring any alcohol 
            with you.
